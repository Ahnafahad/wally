    question: 'How did I do this month?',
    response: 'Let me check... You spent 29,100 this month out of your 43,000 budget — a healthy 68%. Food & Dining is your top category at 12,400. Entertainment is the one to watch — already at 93%. Overall you are tracking well!'
  },
  'where-overspending': {
    question: 'Where am I overspending?',
    response: 'Entertainment is at 93% with days still left in the month — that is your main risk. Shopping is at 73% too. I would suggest skipping non-essentials for the rest of February to stay green.'
  },
  'can-i-afford-goal': {
    question: 'Can I afford my goal?',
    response: 'Your Laptop Fund needs 45,000 more by March 31. That is about 2 months. At your current savings rate you will come up short. Bumping contributions to 10,000 per month and cutting discretionary spending will close the gap.'
  },
  'credit-card-health': {
    question: 'How is my credit card health?',
    response: 'Combined balance is 31,300 against a 1,75,000 limit — 18% utilization. Excellent! City Bank Visa due Feb 15, BRAC Mastercard due Feb 20. Both are manageable. Keep utilization below 30% for best results.'
  },
  'budget-suggestions': {
    question: 'Give me budget suggestions',
    response: 'Food has room — raise it to 20,000 since you average 16,000. Entertainment should drop to 2,500 — you consistently hit 90 percent. Healthcare at 3,000 is a good buffer to keep as is.'
  },
  'savings-rate': {
    question: 'What is my savings rate?',
    response: 'Over the past 12 months you have saved an average of 22 percent of your income. Best month was March. That puts you ahead of the national average. Keep it up!'
  },
  'compare-months': {
    question: 'Compare this month to last month',
    response: 'Compared to January you are on pace to spend about the same. Food is slightly up 8 percent but Transport is down 12 percent. Entertainment is the outlier — January was 78 percent, this month already 93 percent.'
  },
  'food-spending-detail': {
    question: 'Tell me more about my food spending',
    response: 'Food & Dining is at ৳12,400 this month. Biggest spends: Shwapno (৳3,200) and Foodpanda (৳2,800). You are ordering Foodpanda almost daily — cutting to 3 times a week saves about ৳1,800. Home-cooked meals on weekdays make the biggest dent.'
  },
  'budget-overruns': {
    question: 'Which months did I go over budget?',
    response: 'Food went over in Jan (+৳1,200) and Entertainment hit 93% this month with days left. The pattern: weekend dining and late-night streaming add up fast. Sticking to a daily food cap of ৳500 on weekdays keeps you in the green most months.'
  },
  'savings-improvement': {
    question: 'How can I improve my savings rate?',
    response: 'At 22% you are above average — good foundation. To push higher: auto-transfer ৳3,000 on salary day; your Foodpanda habit costs about ৳2,800/month so cutting half saves ৳1,400; and the Entertainment budget needs a hard cap at ৳2,500 to stop the month-end creep.'

    question: 'Where am I overspending?',

    question: 'Can I afford my goal?',
    response: 'Bali Trip is almost there — just 18,000 to go. You will hit it by end of February. Apartment Down Payment is at 39 percent, perfectly on track for mid 2027. The MBA Fund could use a bump to 12,000 per month.'

    question: 'Give me budget suggestions',
    response: 'Your 50-30-20 split is currently 63-25-12. I would shift to 55-25-20 by trimming Food slightly and boosting goal contributions. Education budget could go to 7,000 — it is an investment in your future.'
  },
  'savings-rate': {
    question: 'What is my savings rate?',
    response: 'Your trailing 12-month savings rate is 38 percent — outstanding! Last month you hit 42 percent, your personal best. Goals are collectively at 36 percent completion. You are in excellent financial health.'
  },
  'compare-months': {
    question: 'Compare this month to last month',
    response: 'January vs February so far: total spending is 15 percent lower. Food is similar, Shopping way down 28 percent, Education up 45 percent — that Coursera subscription. Budget adherence is improving month over month.'
  },
  'food-spending-detail': {
    question: 'Tell me more about my food spending',
    response: 'Your top food merchants: Shwapno (৳4,200), Meena Bazar (৳3,800), and Foodpanda (৳3,100). Weekends account for 60% of your food spend. Meal-prepping Sunday evenings and limiting Foodpanda to twice a week could save ৳2,500–3,000 this month alone.'
  },
  'budget-shift-detail': {
    question: 'Why should I shift Shopping to Education?',
    response: 'Shopping is at ৳9,800 of ৳15,000 — you have ৳5,200 of headroom. Education at ৳2,100 of ৳5,000 has room too, but courses compound in value unlike most purchases. Shifting ৳2,000 this month puts you on pace to finish your Coursera target by April — a much better ROI.'
  },
  'goal-contribution-plan': {
    question: 'Help me optimize my goal contributions',
    response: 'Emergency Fund is ahead of schedule — consider pausing the extra top-ups and redirecting. MBA Fund needs the push: ৳15,000/month gets you there by Aug 2026. Bali Trip just needs one ৳18,000 contribution to close out. Priority order: MBA Fund → Bali Trip → Apartment Down Payment.'
  },
  'budget-overruns': {
    question: 'Which months did I go over budget?',
    response: 'You went over in March (Food +12%), July (Entertainment +8%), and October (Shopping +15%). The pattern: month-end splurges. A hard daily cap in the last week of each month kept you green the other 9 months. Your Nov–Jan streak is your best run yet.'
  },
  'savings-improvement': {
    question: 'How can I improve my savings rate?',
    response: 'At 38% you are already strong. Three quick levers: auto-transfer ৳10,000 on salary day before you can spend it; ride-hailing averages ৳2,800/month — bus 3 days a week saves ৳800; and your streaming subscriptions total ৳1,200 — audit which ones you actually use.'
