    question: 'How did I do this month?',
    response: 'Let me check... You spent 29,100 this month out of your 43,000 budget — a healthy 68%. Food & Dining is your top category at 12,400. Entertainment is the one to watch — already at 93%. Overall you are tracking well!'
  },
  'where-overspending': {
    question: 'Where am I overspending?',
    response: 'Entertainment is at 93% with days still left in the month — that is your main risk. Shopping is at 73% too. I would suggest skipping non-essentials for the rest of February to stay green.'

  'can-i-afford-goal': {
    question: 'Can I afford my goal?',
    response: 'Your Laptop Fund needs 45,000 more by March 31. That is about 2 months. At your current savings rate you will come up short. Bumping contributions to 10,000 per month and cutting discretionary spending will close the gap.'

  'credit-card-health': {
    question: 'How is my credit card health?',
    response: 'Combined balance is 31,300 against a 1,75,000 limit — 18% utilization. Excellent! City Bank Visa due Feb 15, BRAC Mastercard due Feb 20. Both are manageable. Keep utilization below 30% for best results.'
  },
  'budget-suggestions': {
    question: 'Give me budget suggestions',
    response: 'Food has room — raise it to 20,000 since you average 16,000. Entertainment should drop to 2,500 — you consistently hit 90 percent. Healthcare at 3,000 is a good buffer to keep as is.'
  },
  'savings-rate': {
    question: 'What is my savings rate?',
    response: 'Over the past 12 months you have saved an average of 22 percent of your income. Best month was March. That puts you ahead of the national average. Keep it up!'
  },
  'compare-months': {
    question: 'Compare this month to last month',
    response: 'Compared to January you are on pace to spend about the same. Food is slightly up 8 percent but Transport is down 12 percent. Entertainment is the outlier — January was 78 percent, this month already 93 percent.'

    question: 'Give me budget suggestions',
    response: 'Your 50-30-20 split is currently 63-25-12. I would shift to 55-25-20 by trimming Food slightly and boosting goal contributions. Education budget could go to 7,000 — it is an investment in your future.'
